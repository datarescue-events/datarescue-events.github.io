## {{ site.title }}

**{{ site.title }}** are organized by local coordinators and sponsored by [**Environmental Data and Governance Initiative**](https://envirodatagov.org/) (EDGI) and PPEHlab’s  [**Data Refuge**](http://www.ppehlab.org/datarefuge) project.

Events bring together scientists, coders, archivists, librarians, and volunteers to identify and preserve at-risk datasets in collaboration with the Internet Archive. In the three months following the 2016 election, events worked to extensively seed the Internet Archive’s End of Term Harvest project.
